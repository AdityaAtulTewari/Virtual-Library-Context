# Class "U" is used internally by the setparams program to mean
# "unknown". This means that if you don't specify CLASS=
# on the command line, you'll get an error. It would be nice
# to be able to avoid this, but we'd have to get information
# from the setparams back to the make program, which isn't easy.
